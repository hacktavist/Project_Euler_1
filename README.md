Project Euler Solution 1
=================

###My solution for the first problem on projecteuler.net

* this is written in javascript; I would have preferred to use ruby, but I am on a computer without it; I might add a ruby version later
* I have added an angular app that expands on the javascript solution. This simple app asks for a number to be input, and then when the button is clicked it adds all of the numbers that are divisible by 3 OR 5 below the input number.
* I have also changed the structure of folders to have the js solution seperate from the angular solution

The ng-boilerplate code that I have used comes from github user [benwells](https://github.com/benwells/ng-boilerplate). It is great for getting a mockup angular app together in just a few minutes.
